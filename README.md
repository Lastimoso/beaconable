# Beaconable

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Lastimoso/beaconable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Lastimoso/beaconable) [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/esta/issues)

Small OO patern to isolate side-effects and callbacks for your ActiveRecord Models.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'beaconable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install beaconable

## Usage
When you include Beaconable in your model it will fire your Beacon everytime after you create or save an entry. Inside your Beacon you have access to the following:

- object (and an alias with the name of your model, i.e user): the instance of your object after changes.
- object_was (and an alias with the name of your model, i.e. user_was): the instance of your object as it was before your changes
- field_changed?(:field_name) : It allows you to check if a specific field was modified.
- any_field_changed?(:field_name, :other_field_name) : It allows you to check if any of multiple fields was modified.
- new_entry? : Returns true if the item saved is new
- destroyed_entry? :  Returns true if the item has been destroyed

You can also used the following chained methods
- field_change(:field_name).from('first_alternative', 'n_alternative').to('first_alternative_for_to', 'second_alternative_for_to', 'n_alternative_for_toq')

### Rails Generator
You can use the bundled generator if you are using the library inside of
a Rails project:

    rails g beacon User

This will do the following:
1. Create a new beacon file in `app/beacons/user_beacon.rb`
2. Will add "include Beaconable" in your User Model.


### Beacon Definition

```ruby
class UserBeacon < Beaconable::BaseBeacon
  alias user object
  alias user_was object_was

  def call
    WelcomeUserJob.perform_later(self.id) if new_entry?
    UpdateExternalServiceJob.perform_later(self.id) if field_changed? :email
  end
end
```

### Avoid firing a beacon

You can skip beacon calls if you pass true to the method `#skip_beacon`. I.E:
```
...
 user.update(user_params)
 user.skip_beacon = true
 user.save # The user beacon won't be fired.
```

### Beacon metadata

You can pass `beacon_metadata` to the `object` that will be available on the **Beacon**.

```ruby
User.create(email: "new_user@email.com", skip_welcome_user_job: true)

# app/beacons/user_beacon.rb
class UserBeacon < Beaconable::BaseBeacon
  alias user object
  alias user_was object_was

  def call
    WelcomeUserJob.perform_later(self.id) if should_perform_welcome_user_job?
    UpdateExternalServiceJob.perform_later(self.id) if field_changed? :email
  end

  private

  def should_perform_welcome_user_job?
    new_entry? && !beacon_metadata[:skip_welcome_user_job]
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
